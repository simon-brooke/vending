# vending

A Clojure implementation of the Vending Machine kata, see http://code.joejag.com/coding-dojo-vending-machine/

NOTE! I am LEARNING. This is not an example of how to do it.

## Usage

The state of the machine is represented by a structure which is passed around between functions.

So you can make a machine with make-default-machine:

    vending.repl=> (make-default-machine)
    {:tendered nil, :output nil, :coins {:plack 4, :merk 1, :bawbee 4, :bodle 4}, :change nil, :stock {:teacake 5, :caramel-wafer 5, :snowball 5}, :message ""}

You can add coins to it with add-coin; as this is a Scots machine the coins you can add are merks, placks, bawbees and bodles.

    vending.repl=> (add-coin (add-coin *1 :merk) :bawbee)
    {:message "Added a :bawbee", :tendered (:bawbee :merk), :output nil, :coins {:plack 4, :merk 1, :bawbee 4, :bodle 4}, :change nil, :stock {:teacake 5, :caramel-wafer 5, :snowball 5}}

The machine serves good Scottish super-foods: caramel wafers, teacakes and snowballs. To get a teacake, try

    vending.repl=> (get-teacake *1)
    {:message "Enjoy your :teacake", :coins {:merk 2, :plack 4, :bawbee 4, :bodle 4}, :change (:bawbee), :output (:teacake), :stock {:teacake 4, :caramel-wafer 5, :snowball 5}}

There's very little error checking; if you try to add a dollar, I've no idea what will happen but it probably won't be good.

Finally if you add coins and decide you want them back, you can use coin-return:

    vending.repl=> (coin-return (add-coin (add-coin (make-default-machine) :merk) :plack))
    {:message "Coins returned", :output nil, :coins {:plack 4, :merk 1, :bawbee 4, :bodle 4}, :change (:plack :merk), :stock {:teacake 5, :caramel-wafer 5, :snowball 5}}

## Possible future development

My panned next phase for this is to make it drive an interactive web page, first entirely server-side, and then, if that works, client-side.

Update: the wep page now roughly works (but isn't yet pretty). To play with it, use:

    lein ring server
